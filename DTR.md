1. What are your learning goals for this project?
  * Chris: Learn how to setup an API
  * Robbie: Learn how to create an API for an app that is scalable

2. What is your collaboration style?
  * Chris: 50/50 pairing and independent work. Working on something complex or having problems with a concept lends itself to pairing.
  * Robbie: Pair when necessary or confused, but independent work is usually more productive. Like to pair if I am unsure about a concept.

3. How do you communicate best?
  * Chris: Friendly and open - clear and concise. From the gear-up quiz, tend to be a functional thinker. After Turing hours, better to text if there are any questions or PRs.
  * Robbie: Clear and concise. From the gear-up quiz, tend toward analytical. Always available on Slack, but will use text mainly after Turing hours.

4. What has gone well or poorly in previous projects?
  * Chris: Spent too much time talking and not enough doing (people were insecure in how to proceed). Using Waffle to plan out tasks.
  * Robbie: PRs were too big. Using Waffle for delegating tasks.

5. What do you need to do your best work?
  * Chris: Better motivation working at Turing as opposed to working at home. Using Waffle to have very clear tasks for best communication.
  * Robbie: Using Waffle to have very clear tasks for best communication.

6. Scheduling restrains?
  * Chris: Doctor's appointment Wednesday (unavailable between 5pm and 8pm). Stay at Turing to work until around 7:30 or 8pm. Arrives at Turing around 8:30am.

7. Style for giving feedback?
  * Chris: Positive and actionable.
  * Robbie: Positive and actionable.

8. Biggest strength technically? Area of improvement?
  * Chris: Very logical about thinking things through and seeing the problem. Want to improve on controller design.
